# Auto-zoom

Turning clicks and typing into camera direction.

- Generate zoom ranges from clicks and typing as ordinary timeline items the user edits or disables.
- A zoomed view follows the cursor through a dead zone, panning only as the cursor nears the edge.
- Manual zooms set target, level, and duration, animated or instant.
- A zoom that starts on the first frame starts zoomed in.
- Vertical output follows the cursor continuously, since the frame is narrower than the source.
- Glass loupe magnifies a region in place when a full zoom would move too much of the screen.
- Zoomed text stays sharp: capture at native resolution, and past the source pixel density upscale with a local super-resolution model trained on UI text.

Done when the zoomed view moves smoothly, keeps the cursor in frame, and keeps every clicked element whole.
